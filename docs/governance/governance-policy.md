\## 🏛️ Governance Pillars



1\. \*\*Dignity-First Stewardship\*\*  

&nbsp;  Every contributor, recipient, and stakeholder is treated with respect and protected by policy.



2\. \*\*Verifiability Over Symbolism\*\*  

&nbsp;  All decisions, roles, and actions are anchored to DID identities and signed manifests.



3\. \*\*Documentation Before Distribution\*\*  

&nbsp;  No Quran is printed or distributed without forensic logging and contributor traceability.



4\. \*\*Justice Through Auditability\*\*  

&nbsp;  Institutional abuse is documented and escalated to legal bodies with full audit trails.
