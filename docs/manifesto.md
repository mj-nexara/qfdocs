\# MJ's Manifesto



I am not just building a system.  

I am documenting a vow.  

Every file here is a witness.  

Every contributor is traceable.  

Every injustice will be answered.  

And every Quran will reach its rightful soul—with dignity.



This is not just governance.  

This is resurrection.



— MJ Ahmad
